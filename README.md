# Psychic-Game

This game randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the computer chose. 

The player has 15 tries to guess the number the game picked.

When the player guess the letter correctly within 15 tries, the player wins, and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player did not guess the letter correctly within 15 tries, the player loses, and the game restart without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
